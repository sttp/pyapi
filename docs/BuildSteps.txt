Note: run these steps from root source directory (where setup.cfg is located).

Make sure root-level README.md exists, if not:
    Run CreateReadMeSymLink.cmd to create symbolic link to docs/README.md markdown.
    The .gitignore file ensures that this file will not be checked in since the one in
    the "docs" folder is considered the primary source. If the README.md link in the root
    does not exist or the symbolic link relationship to its parent in the docs folder
    gets broken, delete README.md in the root and re-run CreateReadMeSymLink.cmd again
    before a new build to ensure the README.md will contain the latest updates.

For updates, always increment version number in:
    setup.cfg
    src/sttp/version.py
    docs/conf.py

It is always best to delete the following folders before a new build:
    build/
    dist/

Build Distribution: 
    python -m build

Validate Distribution:
    twine check dist/*

Upload to PiPy:
    twine upload dist/*
