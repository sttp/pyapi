    """
    Example subscriber that groups data by timestamp to the nearest second and publishes grouped data after a specified
    measurement window size has elapsed. This subscriber demonstrates how to group data by timestamp and publish grouped
    data to a user defined callback function. Data is grouped by timestamp to the nearest second and then further grouped
    by subsecond distribution based on the number of samples per second. The grouped data is then published to a user
    defined callback function that handles the grouped data.

    If incoming frame rate is higher than the samples per second, or timestamp alignment does not accurately coinside with
    the subsecond distribution, some data will be downsampled. Downsampled data count is tracked and reported to through the
    `downsampledcount` property.

    Only a single one-second data buffer will be published at a time. If data cannot be processed within the one-second
    window, a warning message will be displayed and any new data will be skipped. The number of skipped data sets is tracked
    and reported through the `processmissedcount` property.

    This example depends on a semi-accurate system clock to group data by timestamp. If the system clock is not accurate,
    data may not be grouped as expected.
